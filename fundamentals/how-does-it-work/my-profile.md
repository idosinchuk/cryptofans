# My profile

In the My Profile tab you will actually see your profile. You can (and should) add a profile photo, a header photo, and a bio.

Subscribers then see the NEXT button to subscribe to that profile. In your case, as a creator, that button will not appear.

Finally, you will see the timeline with all the content you have published.
