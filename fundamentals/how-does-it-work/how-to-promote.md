# How to promote

One of the negative aspects of CryptoFans is that it does not promote its content creators.

This is when you have to use your marketing knowledge and promote your account.

You can offer content previews on Twitter or Instagram and then add the link to your CryptoFans account.

Any strategy is good to attract new subscribers. There are users who also create CryptoFans Telegram groups where they can share these advances.
